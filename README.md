# TreasureChest

## Setup

### Requirements

* Python (>=3.6)
* Sphinx

### Development environment

Create a virtual environment by running:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

The virtual environment should be activated every time you start a new shell session before running subsequent commands:

> On Linux/MacOS:
> ```shell
> source .venv/bin/activate
> ```

> On Windows:
> ```shell
> .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
> ```

**The above steps can also be done with some of the IDEs. eg. PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html>**

run:

You need few dependencies and we are using pre-commit tool to install few Git
hooks to apply basic quality check during commit/push usage.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
 
### Installation

## Usage

### in command line or in your IDE (recommanded)

```
python -m treasurechest --help
```

### in Jupyter for exploration phase

```

## Configuration

All the configuration can be found in config.yml and loaded into the programm
using util/config.py

you can override per user the configuration values by adding a new file
config.$USER.yml, by default this file will not be versionned with Git.

## Test
